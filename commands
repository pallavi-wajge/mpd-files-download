# When I was trying to download mpd file in mp4 format ( audio and video embedded ), there was no direct way. I followed chat gpt's instructions and it worked.

# This is how I went about it:

I canâ€™t directly download files from a .mpd (MPEG-DASH) link, as itâ€™s a streaming format designed for adaptive streaming rather than direct downloading. However, I can guide you on how to download it using tools like youtube-dl, yt-dlp, or other video downloading software.

Using yt-dlp (Recommended Method)
Install yt-dlp

If you donâ€™t have it installed, download it from yt-dlp GitHub or install it via pip:
bash

Copy code
pip install yt-dlp

Download the Video
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

bash

Copy code
yt-dlp -f best -o "video.mp4" "https://internal-vod.sadhguru.org/sessions/ab9f5b3c-d62b-4040-9efa-6f94d48ee31b/vod/index.mpd"

Upload to YouTube
Once downloaded, you can upload the video.mp4 file directly to YouTube.

If you encounter any issues or prefer a different approach, let me know, and Iâ€™ll assist further!

It seems that yt-dlp couldnâ€™t automatically select a format from the .mpd link. Letâ€™s manually list the available formats and then select the appropriate one.

Step 1: List Available Formats
Run this command:

cmd
Copy code
yt-dlp --list-formats "https://internal-vod.sadhguru.org/sessions/ab9f5b3c-d62b-4040-9efa-6f94d48ee31b/vod/index.mpd"
This will display a list of all available video and audio formats.

Step 2: Select the Best Format
After running the above command:

Look for the best video + audio format (usually marked with video+audio or the highest resolution/bitrate).
Use the format code from the list in the following command:
cmd
Copy code
yt-dlp -f <format-code> -o "video.mp4" "https://internal-vod.sadhguru.org/sessions/ab9f5b3c-d62b-4040-9efa-6f94d48ee31b/vod/index.mpd"
Replace <format-code> with the best available format code from the list.

Let me know the output from --list-formats if you're unsure which format to choose, and Iâ€™ll guide you further!

The issue here is that ffmpeg is not installed on your system, and yt-dlp cannot merge the audio and video streams without it. Follow these steps to resolve the problem:


# ffmpeg installation steps:

Step 1: Install FFmpeg
Download FFmpeg:
Go to the official FFmpeg download page.
Alternatively, you can directly download it from FFmpeg Builds.

Extract the Archive:
Extract the downloaded file to a folder (e.g., C:\ffmpeg).

Add FFmpeg to System Path:

Open System Properties â†’ Advanced System Settings â†’ Environment Variables.
Under System Variables, find Path and click Edit.
Add: C:\ffmpeg\bin (or wherever you extracted FFmpeg).
Click OK and restart your Command Prompt.
Verify Installation:
Run this command in Command Prompt:

cmd
Copy code
ffmpeg -version
You should see version details if itâ€™s installed correctly.

Step 2: Redownload and Merge the Video and Audio
Run the same command again:

cmd
Copy code
yt-dlp -f "7+0" -o "video.mp4" "https://internal-vod.sadhguru.org/sessions/ab9f5b3c-d62b-4040-9efa-6f94d48ee31b/vod/index.mpd"
This time, yt-dlp will automatically use ffmpeg to merge the video and audio files.

You said:
i am not able to find the file
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Letâ€™s locate your video.mp4 file step by step:

âœ… Step 1: Search for the File
Open File Explorer.
In the search bar (top-right corner), type:
css
Copy code
video.mp4
Wait for Windows to search your entire system. It may take a few moments.
âœ… Step 2: Check the Default Directory
By default, yt-dlp saves files to the current working directory. Since you ran the command from:

makefile
Copy code
C:\Users\isha
Open File Explorer.
Navigate to:
makefile
Copy code
C:\Users\isha
Look for video.mp4.
âœ… Step 3: Verify with Command Prompt
Open Command Prompt and run this command:

cmd
Copy code
dir C:\Users\isha\video.mp4 /s
This will search for video.mp4 within the C:\Users\isha directory and its subfolders.

âœ… Step 4: Re-Specify Output Location (if not found)
If you still canâ€™t find it, re-run the download command and explicitly set the path:

cmd
Copy code
yt-dlp -f "7+0" -o "C:\Users\isha\Downloads\video.mp4" "https://internal-vod.sadhguru.org/sessions/ab9f5b3c-d62b-4040-9efa-6f94d48ee31b/vod/index.mpd"

You said:
there's no audio
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It seems that the audio file might not have been merged properly, possibly because yt-dlp didnâ€™t download or merge the audio stream correctly. Let's try fixing that.

âœ… Step 1: Check Available Formats Again
First, let's confirm if both video and audio streams are available.

Run the following command to list all available formats for the stream:

cmd
Copy code
yt-dlp --list-formats "https://internal-vod.sadhguru.org/sessions/bc916323-f1ad-4682-b4d8-276b242b53b7/vod/index.mpd"
Check the output to verify that both video and audio streams are listed. We need to confirm the correct audio format ID.

âœ… Step 2: Redownload and Merge Video + Audio
If the audio format is missing or not properly merged, we can try downloading and merging the streams again:

Manually select audio and video formats:
From the list above, identify the best audio format (usually the one labeled with m4a or mp4a codec).
Select the best video format (e.g., the highest resolution).
For example, if:

Video is ID 7 (1280x720),
Audio is ID 0 (m4a audio),
Use the following command to explicitly download and merge them:

cmd
Copy code
yt-dlp -f "7+0" -o "C:\Users\isha\Downloads\sp_hin.mp4" "https://internal-vod.sadhguru.org/sessions/bc916323-f1ad-4682-b4d8-276b242b53b7/vod/index.mpd"
âœ… Step 3: Ensure FFmpeg is Available for Merging
Make sure FFmpeg is working to merge video and audio. If itâ€™s not installed or not recognized, we canâ€™t merge the streams. If it hasnâ€™t been added to your PATH, follow the steps I provided earlier to set it up.

Let me know the result:
Once youâ€™ve confirmed the formats or tried downloading again, let me know if you face any issues with the audio, and Iâ€™ll guide you further! ðŸ˜Š

To abort a running command in Command Prompt, simply follow these steps:

Press Ctrl + C on your keyboard while the command is running.
This will stop the current process and return you to the command prompt.
After Aborting:
Once the process is aborted:

Check whether any files were partially downloaded (you might see .m4a or .mp4 files in the directory you were working in).
Re-run the command after ensuring that FFmpeg is properly installed and the formats are correctly selected.
If youâ€™re still experiencing issues after aborting, let me know, and Iâ€™ll assist you further! ðŸ˜Š
